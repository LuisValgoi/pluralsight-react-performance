- Avoid wasted rendering
- Reducing the bundle size of the app
- Loading components on demand
- Caching expensive operation results

**## BEWARE**

Premature optimization is a trap

- Almost all the time is a time-wasted
- It's hard to prevent / mitigate all the wasted renders

**## HOW RENDER WORKS**

1 - React asks for components about their latest markup;

2 - Pushes that markup back into the Browser DOM;

- THE PROBLEM: If we need to do this procedure all over again, it makes the app unusable.

3 - It maps the markups added, removed, changed and adds into the Virtual DOM.

4 - React does not take every render and reconcile with the Actual DOM.

- It's smart enought to loop and knows when there is enought changes that needs to publish to the DOM
- It's a very cheap in-memory structure.

**## TIPS**

- `React.PureComponent`: equal to the `React.memo`.
    - But `React.memo` its more flexible b/c it accepts a function to do the props comparison.
        - CLASS: `shouldComponentUpdate`
        - FUNCTIONAL: `2nd props`

```
function MyComponent(props) {
  /* renderize usando props */
}
function areEqual(prevProps, nextProps) {
  /*
  se prevProps e nextProps renderizam o mesmo resultado,
  retorne true.
  caso contr√°rio, retorne false.
  */
}
export default React.memo(MyComponent, areEqual);
```
